# BEHAVIORAL-BIOMETRICS-FOR-AUTHENTICATION
This basic project investigates keystroke dynamics as a behavioral biometric for Network Security. By analyzing typing patterns like hold and flight times, combined with OTP in a multi-factor authentication setup, it enhances user verification.

This project, titled "Behavioral Biometrics for Authentication," serves as a fundamental exploration and demonstration of keystroke dynamics for network security. Conducted as part of a midterm group assignment in the Network Security course, this project does not involve complex model training but instead focuses on implementing basic authentication techniques using behavioral biometrics.

The system leverages keystroke dynamics, specifically analyzing metrics such as hold time (key press duration) and flight time (interval between key transitions), to create a unique typing pattern for each user. This pattern enables the system to continuously authenticate users by comparing their real-time typing behavior with established norms. Additionally, an One-Time Password (OTP) feature is integrated as a second authentication factor, aligning the project with multi-factor authentication (MFA) principles and enhancing security.

Using threshold-based validation for consistency checks, the project demonstrates how behavioral biometrics can provide a robust, non-intrusive layer of security. Although basic, this system aims to highlight the potential of keystroke dynamics in real-time, continuous authentication settings, offering valuable insights into the practical application of behavioral biometrics for secure user verification.

This project contributes to foundational knowledge in behavioral biometrics and network security, serving as an educational tool to introduce the core concepts of continuous, behavior-based authentication without the need for advanced machine learning models.
